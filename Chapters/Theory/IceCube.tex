IceCube is the first kilometre-scale neutrino detector and is located at the South Pole starting at 1450 metres below the surface, with a total of $5160$ optical sensors for detecting the Cherenkov light produced by the particle interactions \cite{Aartsen_2017}. A sketch of the observatory is shown in figure \ref{fig:IceCubeDetector}. The primary array consists of 78 strings (cables) with a length of $\SI{1}{km}$ distributed over a square kilometre, each holding $60$ digital optical modules (DOMs) at $\SI{17}{m}$ vertical intervals. The horizontal inter-string distance is $\SI{125}{m}$, which allows the investigation of neutrinos in the energy range between $\SI{100}{GeV}$ and $\mathcal{O}(\textrm{PeV})$. The DOMs incorporate a 10-inch-diameter photomultiplier tube (PMT) facing down, inside a glass pressure vessel, with circuit boards that allow near-autonomous operation. PMTs are extremely sensitive devices capable of measuring single photons. These are described later in this thesis in chapter \ref{ch:PMTs}.
\par Eight additional strings separated in average by about $\SI{72}{m}$ are located in the centre of the detector. The modules are deployed at depths of $\SI{2100}{m}$ to $\SI{2450}{m}$ with an inter-sensor spacing of only $\SI{7}{m}$. This more densely instrumented sub-detector is called \textit{DeepCore} and is optimised to detect neutrinos of energies in the order of tens of $\textrm{GeV}$. 
\par On the surface is located \textit{IceTop}, which consist of water tanks near the top of each string, with two DOMs each, forming a square kilometre air shower array. This can be used as a veto against atmospheric neutrinos and as a detector for cosmic rays in the $\SI{300}{TeV}$ to $\SI{1}{EeV}$ region. All the cables from the detector are routed to the IceCube Laboratory, which is the operation building of the detector located at the surface in the centre of the array. 
\par The IceCube's commissioning was completed 2011 and since then it has already discovered a flux of high-energy neutrinos of cosmic origin \cite{Kopper2013}. An overview of the recent findings of IceCube regarding astrophysical neutrinos and cosmic rays can be found in \cite{Aartsen_2017_Results}. Nevertheless, the modest number of events limits the efficiency of this observatory. Therefore a substantial expansion of the detector is sought, \textit{IceCube-Gen2}, aiming the instrumentation of up to $\SI{10}{km^3}$ of glacial ice with novel technology \cite{1412.5106}.

\subsection{IceCube-Gen2}
The benchmark detector layout for IceCube-Gen2 considers the extension of $120$ new strings, aiming for the detection of high-energy neutrinos, sometimes called \textit{HEA} (High-Energy Array)\cite{1412.5106}.
\par Following the calibration and building of IceCube the optical properties of the ice are now known with great detail over large depth range. The absorption length of the ice for Cherenkov light is larger than initially thought and exceeds $\SI{100}{m}$-$\SI{200}{m}$ depending on the depth. This enables the instrumentation of considerable larger volumes with lower string densities than in IceCube. In this context, spacings between $\SI{240}{m}$ and $\SI{300}{m}$ are being considered. An example string layout is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:IceCubeGen2Detector}. The larger spacing results in a higher energy threshold above $\sim \SI{50}{TeV}$, but it does not represent a loss of astrophysical neutrino signal. Because of the size of the detector, the HEA should be capable of measuring neutrinos up to the $\mathcal{O}(\textrm{EeV})$ level.
\par Besides the HEA, an extension of DeepCore is being proposed: \textit{PINGU}, a dense array for the detection of low-energy neutrinos, which will target precision measurements of the atmospheric oscillation parameters and neutrino mass hierarchy \cite{1412.5106}. An expansion of the IceTop array is also considered in the scope of IceCube-Gen2.

\par The detector sensitivities for neutrino point sources scale approximately with the square-root of the increase in its cross-sectional area, but linearly with the angular resolution. The latter can be further improved with different approaches, e.g. advanced reconstruction methods and a more detailed model of the ice properties. In this respect, also new optical sensors are being proposed, which will increase not only the angular resolution but also the overall efficiency.
\par Two new concepts for optical sensors are being studied: one the one side the employment of wavelength-shifting and light-guiding techniques for an increased sensitivity to UV photons and hence the Cherenkov spectrum, represented by the WOM project (Wavelength-shifting Optical Module) \cite{WOM}. On the other side, the segmentation of the active area of the modules using several PMTs is being investigated. There are two approaches for this, the DEgg which consist of two 8'' PMTs facing down and upwards \cite{DEGG}, and the mDOM (multi-PMT Digital Optical Module), which features multiple small photomultiplier tubes \cite{mDOM}. A more detailed introduction to the latter is presented in the next section.
\subsubsection{The multi-PMT digital optical module}

    \label{fig:DOM}
\end{wrapfigure}
The mDOM consist of $24$ 3-inch-diameter PMT facing multiple directions, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:mDOM}. In contrast, the current IceCube DOM is shown in figure \ref{fig:DOM}. The mDOM PMTs are mounted surrounded by a reflector, which increase the sensitive area of the module \cite[160]{LEW}, on a 3D-printed holding structure. An active base is attached to the end of the PMT and provides the latter with high-voltage and reads out its output. The signals are digitised by the mainboard, located at the equatorial plane in the centre of the module. All this components are enclosed by a glass pressure vessel, which protects the module against the rough external conditions. Between the vessel and the internal components of the module, there is a layer of optical gel, which acts as an optical coupler, preventing light reflections due to the different refraction indices of the glass and air.
\par The segmentation of the sensitive area results in a range of advantages compared to the conventional single-PMT DOM, such as:
\noindent
\hspace*{0.3cm} $\bullet$ a larger effective area (hypothetical geometrical area of the module assuming $\SI{100}{\percent}$ detection efficiency), since $24$ 3-inch PMT provide a larger total photocathode surface than one 10-inch PMT. Moreover, the mDOM has a near homogeneous $4\pi$ angular acceptance, in contrast to the DOM, where the sensitivity for down-going light is almost zero.\\
\hspace*{0.3cm} $\bullet$ intrinsic directional sensitivity, as the PMT orientation entails information about the direction of the detected light. In the case of the DOM, this is very limited due to the large field of view of its PMT.\\
\hspace*{0.3cm} $\bullet$ better photon-counting, as the photons are detected among different PMTs, their number and arriving time can be reconstructed more easily, unlike a multi-photon waveform from a single photomultiplier. Consequently, multiple PMTs also feature a better performance regarding saturation.\\
\hspace*{0.3cm} $\bullet$ the possibility for development of reconstruction algorithms based on local coincidences, i.e. correlated signals in several PMTs from a single module. This enables novel methods for background suppression, PMT self-calibration \cite[215]{LEW} and a higher efficiency and better reconstruction of low-energetic signals, such as supernova neutrinos, as shown in recent studies \cite{cris}.\\
\par Besides the technological improvements being made with the active constituents of the module, also the optical properties of the passive components can be enhanced. In this perspective, alternative brands for the vessel glass and the optical gel are being considered.

\par The main function of the pressure vessel is to endure pressures up to $\SI{700}{bar}$. Due to the temperature gradient of the glacier, the water freezes from the top downwards, resulting in a high-pressure excess of up to $\SI{690}{bar}$ \cite{Aartsen_2017}. Consequently the vessel has to be quite thick (over $\SI{1}{cm}$ at the current DOM), which makes the transparency of the material very important, as a portion of light will get absorbed in it. The current operating neutrino telescopes use vessels from borosilicate glass. The transmission spectrum of this material exhibits a wavelength cut-off at around $\SI{300}{nm}$, depending on the glass thickness and manufacturer. In this respect, the Vitrovex brand, the standard glass used by Nautilus GmbH., presents an improved transmission in the UV region compared to the one currently used in the DOMs called Benthos, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:TransmissionComparison}. For the mDOM's vessel, which has a wall-thickness of $\SI{13}{mm}$, this difference results in $\sim \SI{13}{\percent}$ more Cherenkov photons in the range of $\SI{300}{nm}$ to $\SI{700}{nm}$ being detected. 
\par The silicon-based optical gels tend to feature better transparency in the UV range, reducing its influence on the overall performance of the module compared to the glass. Nevertheless, brands offering higher transmittance to the currently used in IceCube are being considered for the mDOM, such as SilGel 612 from Wacker and the optical gel produced in Chiba, Japan, for the DEgg module. Their transmission at $\SI{5}{mm}$\footnote{The thickness of the gel-layer in front of the PMT varies between $\SI{2}{mm}$ and $\SI{25}{mm}$ depending on the location.} thickness is shown in figure \ref{fig:TransmissionComparison}. As the cut-off of the glass is much higher than the one of the gels, the difference regarding the number of transmitted photons in the interval between $\SI{300}{nm}$ to $\SI{700}{nm}$ is of only a few percentage points.
\par However, aiming at choosing the best material, there are other factors to be taken into account. Different brands exhibit various levels of trace radiation, which is an important aspect of the measured background, as decay products can produce Cherenkov light and also scintillation photons (see chapter REF). This thesis focuses on this topic and investigates the influence of the radioactive isotopes presented in the material on the overall noise of the mDOM, as a detailed understanding of the background production mechanisms is crucial for the signal processing and reconstruction. In this context, both glass brands, Benthos and Vitrovex, and the QSI and Wacker gel are investigated. The optical gel used in Chiba was unfortunately not available for measurements.
