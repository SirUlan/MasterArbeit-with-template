\section{Neutrino properties and interactions}
Neutrinos are elementary particles included in the lepton family and thus an integral part of the Standard Model of particle physics. They are quasi-massless\footnote{Although the neutrino mass is not exactly known, they are so light that the gravitational force can be neglected in their interactions.}, do not possess electrical charge and, being leptons, do not undergo strong interaction. Henceforth, neutrinos can only interact through the weak force. 
\par These particles come in three flavours, electron, muon and tau neutrinos, corresponding to the three charged leptons. A variety of experiments in the last decades have proven that the neutrino lepton flavour is not conserved, since the flavour of a neutrino flux can partially change after propagation in vacuum or matter. This process is referred to as neutrino oscillation. Until now, the only consistent explanation for this property is a nonzero neutrino mass, opposed as initially considered in the Standard Model \cite{Olive_2016}. 
\par The neutrino properties make their direct detection impossible and it has to be carried out via charged secondary particles produced in interactions. At high energies (>$\SI{10}{GeV}$), these interactions are dominated by deep inelastic scattering with nucleons. Depending on the exchanged boson, there are two branches in which neutrinos will engage, the neutral current (exchange of a $Z^{0}$) or the charged current (exchange of a $W^{\pm}$):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:interactions}
    \nu_l+N \xrightarrow{Z^{0}} \nu_l+X,\hspace{1cm} \nu_l+N \xrightarrow{W^{\pm}} l+X,
\end{equation}
where $\nu_l$ represents a neutrino (or antineutrino) with the lepton flavour $l$, $N$ denotes a nucleon (proton or neutron), $l$ the emitted lepton (or antilepton) and $X$ represents further rest products of the interaction, which can be one or more hadronic particles. In equation \ref{eq:interactions} the lepton flavour is strictly conserved, which may seem conflicting with the already mentioned neutrino oscillation. It has to be emphasised that the flavour change is a consequence of the flavour mixture of mass eigenstates after propagation. The violation of lepton flavour number in an interaction implies a CPT symmetry breaking \cite{D_az_2016}, a violation that at this time has not being confirmed by experiments \cite{hep-ph/0611177}.
\par As neutrinos posses a very small cross-section, they rarely interact with matter. Therefore, large interaction volumes are needed for the detection of a sufficient number of these particles. This is especially true for naturally occurring neutrinos, like the ones of astrophysical sources, since their flux is quite low compared to e.g. neutrinos produced in reactors.

\section[Detection of high-energy neutrinos via Cherenkov radiation]{\large{Detection of high-energy neutrinos via Cherenkov radiation}}
\label{sec:cherenkov}
As we already saw, neutrinos cannot be measured directly. The charged secondary particles emitted in interactions such as the ones of equation \ref{eq:interactions} can, however, be detected by different techniques. The most widespread method is detection via Cherenkov effect, which is used, e.g. for the detection of high-energy neutrinos in large volume neutrino telescopes such ANTARES, BDUNT, NESTOR and IceCube \cite{Ageron_2011, DBUNT, Rapidis_2009, Aartsen_2017}. This effect will be explained in this section. Nevertheless, depending on the energy range and issue of study others techniques have been used, such as radiochemical methods(such as the GALLEX/GNO and SAGE experiments \cite{xing2011neutrinos}), tracking calorimeters (MINOS, NO$\nu$A \cite{Backhouse_2015}) and radio detectors (ANITA, RICE, ARA \cite{ANITA,RICE,Meures_2015}).  \hfill

\end{wrapfigure}
\par The Cherenkov effect takes place when a charged particle passes through a dielectric at speeds
 greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. The electric field of the particle polarises the medium (small displacements by a vast number of electrons) and upon the de-excitation of the electrons (return to their normal position), radiation is emitted. If the charged particle is slower than the phase velocity of this radiation, this emission interferes destructively. If this is not the case, i.e. it is faster than light in the medium, the wavelets of the track are in phase overlapping constructively on a wavefront, causing the coherent emission of photons \cite{Jelley_1955}. A sketch of this process is shown in figure \ref{fig:CherenkovProcess}. The Cherenkov radiation is released in the form of a cone with an opening angle $\theta$ relative to the particle's trajectory.  This angle is defined by the velocity of the wavefronts $v_w = \dfrac{c}{n}$, which depends on the refraction index of the medium $n$, and the velocity of the charged particle $v_p = \beta \cdot c$, where $\beta$ is the ratio of $v_p$ to the speed of light $c$. Following figure \ref{fig:CherenkovProcess} it is given by:
\begin{equation}
\cos(\theta) = \dfrac{c\cdot t \cdot n^{-1}}{\beta \cdot c \cdot t} = \dfrac{1}{\beta \cdot n}.
\end{equation}
With the condition for Cherenkov effect $\beta > n^{-1}$ we can directly determine the minimal kinetical energy $E_{\rm{th}}$ of a charged particle for the production of Cherenkov light:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\rm{kin}} = (\gamma-1) m_{0} c^2 =m_{0} c^2 \big(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}-1\big) > E_{\rm{th}} =m_{0} c^2\big(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-n^{-2}}}-1\big) =  m_{0}c^2\big(\sqrt{\dfrac{n^2}{n^2-1}}-1\big),
\end{equation}
where $m_0$ is the invariant mass of the particle and $\gamma = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$ the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the energy threshold only depends on the refraction index of the medium. Inserting the characteristic index for ice $n=1.31$, the needed kinetic energy will be $\sim \SI{55}{\percent}$ of its rest energy. For larger refraction indices this energy threshold gets lower, as for a typical glass with $n=1.48$ only $\sim \SI{36}{\percent}$ of the particle's rest energy. For an electron this results in $\sim \SI{0.28}{MeV}$ and  $\sim \SI{0.18}{MeV}$ respectively.

\par The spectrum of the emission and the number of photons radiated per unit length can be approximated by the Frank-Tamm formula \cite{Frank_1991}
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2 N}{dxd\lambda} = \frac{2\pi\alpha}{\lambda^2}\cdot \Big(1-\frac{1}{\beta^2 n(\lambda)^2} \Big),
\end{equation*}
where $N$ is the number of emitted photons and $\alpha\approx\frac{1}{137.04}$ the fine structure constant. It is noteworthy, that the emission spectrum is in first order proportional to $\lambda^{-2}$, although there is a small dependence on the refraction index of the medium $n(\lambda)$. 
By recording the number of emitted photons and its time distribution, different light patterns can be identified, with which it is possible to reconstruct the energy and direction of the charged particle. 
\par The light signatures produced by leptons after a charged current neutrino interaction are reasonably distinctive depending on their flavour, as their lifetime and probability of interaction vary. These signatures start at the interaction vertex, where a hadronic cascade originating from the debris of the hit nucleon takes place, which produces a near-spherical mark. Electrons or positrons travel very short distances, as electromagnetic cascades are quickly generated as a result of scattering in the medium, bremsstrahlung and pair production. Altogether, their signatures resemble a point source with the maximum photon production in the center and are called \textbf{showers}. In contrast, high energetic muons can travel very long distances before they decay or are stopped and thus produce a \textbf{track}-like signature. Tau neutrinos will emit a tauon, which after a short distance decays via the weak interaction into a muon, electron or producing light mesons. These particles will create an electromagnetic or a hadronic cascade respectively. As a spherical light emission is created by both cascades, the hadronic one at the interaction vertex and the one originated from the tau decay, the signature is referred as a \textbf{double-bang}. An example of these three signatures can be seen in figure \ref{fig:tracks}.
\par A shower signature is also created by all neutrino flavours undergoing a neutral current interaction, as it only induce a hadronic cascade. The energy of the neutrino can be well reconstructed from the total light deposition with this kind of signatures, as all the energy is deposited inside of a relatively small volume, but due to its almost spherical shape limits the direction reconstruction to only the time information. Track signatures, on the other side, allow for a very precise directional reconstruction, although for deriving the initial energy of the neutrino accurately, the interaction vertex has to be measured within the detector.
\par The IceCube observatory uses this method for the detection of neutrinos. In the next section the different parts of this detector and its main features are discussed.
