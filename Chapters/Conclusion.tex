\chapter{Summary and outlook}

The aim of this work was to study the background caused by radioactive decays inside the multi-PMT digital optical module, a new optical sensor being proposed for future IceCube extensions. As the deep ice at the South Pole has a very low optical activity, light produced by the mDOM itself represents the dominant background source. Two major sources are Cherenkov and scintillation light produced by radioactive decays inside the glass of the module's pressure vessel. Since so far the luminescence of the glass has not been studied in great detail, the main focus of this thesis was its characterisation. This included the determination of the amount of radioactivity found in the material, as well as the full parameterisation of the observed scintillation. In this context, not only the glass was studied, but also the gel used as an optical coupler between the PMTs and the glass of the module was investigated. 
\par In the scope of this thesis two glass brands were studied - Vitrovex, which will be used in the mDOM prototype, and Benthos glass of the original IceCube DOM - and also two gel brands - Wacker SilGel 612 and the current default QSI Qgel 900. During the investigations of this work, it was observed that the Wacker gel undergoes undesired crystallisation, turning hard and opaque at low temperatures, which excludes it from being considered for the mDOM design.
\par The amount of radioactivity in these materials was investigated by means of gamma spectroscopy. A quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted for a total of eight gamma-ray spectra, considering four Vitrovex samples, two Benthos specimens and one sample of each gel brand. In all glass samples, gamma-ray emission from isotopes of the three natural decay chains - $\ch{^{238}U}$, $\ch{^{235}U}$ and $\ch{^{232}Th}$ - was measured. The calculation of their activity indicated that these decay series were in good approximation in secular equilibrium, which allows to estimate the activities of isotopes that cannot be measured with gamma spectroscopy. Furthermore, $\ch{^{40}K}$ was found in three of the Vitrovex samples. These stem from the same production batch and showed similar activities for all detected isotopes, but did deviate a lot with the results of the fourth sample, which exhibited no measurable amounts of $\ch{^{40}K}$. This is also true in the case of the Benthos samples. This suggested that the amount of radioactivity found in the pressure vessels is highly dependent on the production batch. Therefore, more samples should be investigated, in order to make an estimation of how much these values vary between different batches. Moreover, it is very important that the pressure vessel of the first mDOM prototype is studied with gamma spectroscopy before the integration of the module, since the size of the setup was too small for conducting such a measurement during this work. \par In the case of the gel samples, no measurable amount of radioactivity was detected.

 \par The light from scintillation was characterised considering its energy spectrum, the time distribution of the emission and the number of photons released per energy absorbed. Starting with the \textbf{scintillation spectrum}, it was possible to measure the wavelength of the luminescence from the exposure of the samples to two different radioactive sources, an $\ch{^{241}Am}$- $\alpha$- and a stronger $\ch{^{90}Sr}$- $\beta$-source. This gave some information about the nature of this process, as the measured spectra lie near the band gap energy of the material, meaning that the radiative transitions are produced most probably by defects near the conduction and valence band and excluding the possibility of a unique de-excitation centre from the contamination of rare-earth elements. In the case of the Wacker gel sample, no spectrum was measured with the $\alpha$-source, since, following the same reasoning, the bandgap energy of this material lies in the UV-region, where the used PMT is not sensible. A signal was measured with the $\beta$-source, although this was shown by comparing it with simulations to be most probably only Cherenkov radiation.

 \par Yet, there is room for improvement of the experimental approach, as different factors affected the results. On the one hand, the $\alpha$-source excited the air in its surrounding, contaminating the results with the discrete emission of molecular nitrogen. This radioactive source also yields a low-emission intensity, and therefore, a rather low signal to noise ratio. On the other hand, the $\beta$-source provided better results regarding noise, but it also generated Cherenkov photons. Additionally, as the emission was near the transmission cutoff of the sample, information was lost and the real spectrum could not be measured.

\end{wrapfigure}
\par A better approach would be to take advantage of the fact that scintillation light is emitted in all directions equally. Hence, one could measure the light that travelled the shortest path through the sample\footnote{Only a few $\rm{\mu m}$ for excitation with alpha particles.}, by irradiating the sample with $\alpha$-particles with a particular angle towards the entrance of the optical system (see figure \ref{fig:spectrumImproved}). This requires, however, two conditions: on the one hand, the measurement has to be done in a low-pressure environment, so that the $\alpha$-particles reach the sample and to reduce the air scintillation. Also, the $\alpha$-source should have an activity in the order of hundreds of $\rm{GBq}$ for a better signal to noise ratio. This activity may need to be even higher, considering that probably the light must be coupled into an optical fibre if the vacuum chamber is not big enough for the monochromator, which would severely reduce the detection efficiency. This setup, however, should deliver results with no external contamination and almost no information loss due to absorption inside the glass. Also, a PMT sensible in the region between $200$-$\SI{300}{nm}$ should be preferred, as the transmission cutoff of the PMT's window is the next limiting factor after the absorption of the samples.
\par Furthermore, the spectrum measurement should be done at different temperatures, as the scintillation spectrum of most semiconductors changes with it. However, such a study requires first the investigation of the QE of the PMT and the absorption length of the samples as a function of the temperature.
\par The measurement of the \textbf{lifetime} resulted in a long time distribution in the order of $\mu$s for the emission of the glass samples and a much faster one in the order of $\textrm{ns}$ in the case of the gel specimens. For both gel and the Vitrovex sample, the average lifetime decreased with higher temperatures, which was not the case for the specimen of the Benthos glass. This decrease was expected for materials where thermal quenching is an important nonradiative process since it is more probable to release the energy through phononic vibrational states, if these are in higher (thermal) energy levels. However, the measurement was constrained by two factors. On the one side, the number of data points measured in the temperature range was limited by the long duration of the measurement to only five temperatures between $\SI{-50}{\celsius}$ and $\SI{-15}{\celsius}$. In the context of the background simulation of the optical modules, this should not represent any major problem, as the data can be interpolated. Nevertheless, more measurements at different temperatures should be done, if interpretations of the underlying luminescence processes are to be made, especially with the glass samples, since these did show a more erratic behaviour with the temperature. On the other side, the lifetimes had to be corrected, as the time point of the decay was not known. This could be avoided by utilising a more complex setup. For example, the radioactive source could be surrounded by scintillators optically coupled with optical detectors, which can measure the gamma-rays emitted at the decays, e.g.\ the $\SI{59.5}{keV}$ photon emitted with a $\SI{35.9}{\percent}$ probability from the decay of $\ch{^{241}Am}$ \cite{NuclideChart}. This would then trigger the measurement of the waveforms of the PMT measuring the luminescence of the samples, instead of using the first detected photon as the trigger, as it was done in this chapter. However, this would radically increase the duration of the measurement, which would restrain even more the statistics.
\par The determination of the \textbf{scintillation yield} is in hindsight of the other two parameters far simpler, as only the increase of the PMT rate is measured. All samples exhibited a rise of the emission with lower temperatures, except for the Wacker gel, as the crystallisation of the material changed the optical properties of the sample. In the case of the Benthos glass, this emission raise contradicts the results of the lifetime, which however could be explained by the low number of temperatures measured.
\par Moreover, for the calculation of the yield both, the spectra and lifetime of the samples are needed. Hence, any constraints and uncertainties applied to these parameters will also affect the yield results. In this regard, the main improvement for the determination of the yield would be more precise measurements of the lifetime and scintillation spectra, although better results could also be obtained by measuring the rates in a low-pressure environment in order to prevent air scintillation.  Furthermore, in this chapter only the yield for $\alpha$-particles was investigated. As introduced in chapter \ref{ch:scintillation} the intensity of the emission changes with different kind of charged particles, viz.\ the yield for electrons is normally larger than for heavier particles like protons or $\alpha$-particles. The $\beta$-sources that were available for this work were either too strong or encapsulated in transparent plastic, which will probably scintillate by itself. Thus, these sources have to be characterised in more detail if the yield for electrons is to be determined. In addition, the effects of the radiation damage observed on the glass samples regarding the calculated yield should be investigated. A possibility for this would be to measure the rate of scintillation light for a long period with a constant temperature, in order to observe any decrease of the emission due to the darkening of the material caused by the radiation damage.
\par Another remark, it is important to observe that there is a lack of statistic as only one sample of every brand was measured. Since the best assumption is that the scintillation is produced by lattice defects and/or impurity atoms, the luminescence properties will probably vary between different samples, especially between specimens from different production batches. Hence, more samples should be studied for their scintillation properties, in order to determine an expected deviation of the luminescence parameters for the optical modules.
\par With the parameterisation of the scintillation, it is possible to simulate the background from radioactive decays expected to be measured with the mDOM in the deep ice. For this, a combination of a Geant4 and a Python code was developed, which enables the investigation of the time distribution of the background and coincidences between PMTs. Regarding this, some brief simulations were done, which showed that the amount of coincidences is highly dependent on the distance between the coincident PMTs. Taking into account the measured isotope activities, the expected rate per PMT stemming from radioactive decays at $\SI{-35}{\celsius}$ was calculated to be $\SI{429\pm14}{s^{-1}}$.  The scintillation of gel from radioactive decays inside the pressure vessel is relative to this rate neglectable, adding less than $\SI{1.1}{s^{-1}}$ to the total. 
\par An important caveat, however, is that in the calculation of this rate it was assumed a yield for electrons $9.5$ times larger than the one determined for $\alpha$-particles. It was calculated that this rate value would change several tens of percentage points for different electron yield factors. This makes necessary the determination of this parameter in further studies. 

\par In order to validate the methods used in this work, also the background of the DOM was investigated. Here, the simulated rate and time distribution are in good agreement with the experimental data of IceCube. Yet, both, in the IceCube data, as well as in measurements done with a Benthos vessel, correlated noise in long time differences was observed. Due to its temperature behaviour, it is a fair guess to say that it also originates from scintillation light. Owing to the activity of the used $\alpha$-source and the set waveform length of $\SI{100}{\mu s}$, such a long-lived lifetime cannot be measured with the setup used in this work. Further experiments should be conducted in order to confirm these long lifetime emissions in both glass brands.
